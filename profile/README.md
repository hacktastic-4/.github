## Objectives

Create a prototype API in 24 hours capable of processing energy solutions data to generate deep insights that can inform strategy, decision-making, and highlight growth opportunities.

## Problem Statements

1. Usage Pattern Identification: Discover unique energy consumption or generation behaviors.
2. Optimization Recommendations: Suggest tweaks or overhauls to improve energy utilization or generation.
3. Demand & Supply Forecasting: Predict future energy needs and identify potential supply- demand imbalances.
4. ROI Analysis: Assess the potential returns of different energy solutions based on existing data.
5. Geographical Opportunity Visualization: Map areas with high demand but low energy solutions, signaling lucrative avenues for expansion.

## API Features:

-   Deep-Dive Analysis: Delve into datasets to generate meaningful, value-driven insights.
-   Customizable Queries: Empower users to tailor their data inquiries.
-   Adaptable Visualization Tools: Offer adjustable charts and graphs as datasets change and grow.
-   Value-Add Outputs: Ensure outputs provide actionable recommendations and strategic insights in neat JSON Format.

## Deliverables:

-   APIs offering insights on user behavior, demand prediction, geospatial mapping, and ROI analysis
-   API Blueprint: A detailed guide on leveraging the API for insight generation.
-   Analysis Framework: Demonstrate the underlying logic and methodology.
-   Insight Presentation: A focused demonstration of the generated insights and their potential value.
-   User friendly frontend portal
